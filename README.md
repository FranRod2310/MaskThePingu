# Mask the Pingu
This Project was made in Unity during Global Game Jam, in a team of 4, in 48h.

# Objective of the game
In this game you control a brave penguin on an important mission: to catch protective masks spread across the ice to protect other penguins! 
The more masks you collect, the more penguins are safe. 
Beware of obstacles and keep up the pace, as a wave of pollution slowly approaches around the map, reducing space and increasing the challenge at every turn. 
So make sure you return to the tunnel on time.
